# Number-Guessing-Game-in-Python
A simple Python console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback â€” "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct". The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
